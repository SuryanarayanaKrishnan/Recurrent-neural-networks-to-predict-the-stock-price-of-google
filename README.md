# Recurrent-neural-networks-to-predict-the-stock-price-of-google
here i have used 4 LSTM layers each containing 50 units. 60 timesteps are used i.e. the rnn will factor in the last 60 financial days in order to predict the opening stock price of google. Currently working on increasing the parameters so you can expect updates.
